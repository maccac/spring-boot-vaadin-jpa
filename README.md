# spring-boot-vaadin-jpa
Just a hacky little attempt to pull spring-boot, vaadin, jpa, hsqldb together.

I ripped off the customer example from the vaadin site (sorry guys) and then combined it with a few little things from around the place.
There are a few minor modifications along with a stylistic preference towards method references over lamdas for the handler functions.

Enjoy!

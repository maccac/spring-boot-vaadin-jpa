# spring-boot-vaadin-jpa
Just a hacky little attempt to pull the above spring-boot, vaadin, jpa, hsqldb together.

I ripped off the customer example from vaadins site (sorry guys) and then combined it with a few little things here and the. There's a few minor modifications like slightly better naming and stylistic preference towards method references over lamdas for the handler functions. No particular reason, I just like my ui element handlers to have nicer names.
